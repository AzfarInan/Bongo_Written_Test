2. a)  I can implement the Interface to create Plane and Car class and there implement the abstract methods. The code for this scenario is written in interface_implementation.java

2. b)  A different design pattern that can be used for this solution is abstract class. If the Vehicle class is an Abstract class it can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. 
The Car and Plane class will extend the Vehicle class and can override the non-abstract methods if needed and must have to implement abstract classes.
An example scenario is given in modified_code.java
