3. Pseducode for the Play, Rewind and Forward functionlaities of a vidoe player application is written in VideoApp_Pseudocode.md file.

I would use the MVC design pattern to develop these three functionlities. MVC is easier and more organized that's why I would use MVC.
I would write all the Business logic and State related codes in the Model.
I would write all the UI related functionalites and design codes in View and I would use Controller to write the
navigational codes and logics for the connection between View and Model. That's how I would develop these functionalities.
